      <h2>Answers to the questions</h2>
      <p>Does Patrick have a dog?</p>
      <p>Patrick does not currently own a dog. Though he loves them and pets every dog he see, Patrick is currently too busy to have a furry companion. Here is a picture of his last dog, Olive, which he fostered in college.</p>

      <p>No he did not. Before moving to Washigton, Patrick spent his youth in the great state of Louisiana. Please don't make me go back.</p>
